        "\n",
        "  **Abstraction** is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, when you use a method like .sort() on a list in Python, you don't need to know the internal algorithm that sorts the elements—you only care that the list will be sorted. Abstraction simplifies the interface of objects and promotes cleaner, more readable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Encapsulation**, on the other hand, is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit—typically a class—and restricting direct access to some of the object’s internal components. This is often done using access modifiers like private or protected variables. The goal of encapsulation is to protect an object's state from unintended or harmful changes and to enforce a controlled way of interacting with its data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  In short, **abstraction focuses on hiding complexity**, while **encapsulation focuses on hiding the internal state and enforcing access control**. Together, they contribute to more secure, modular, and maintainable code."

A class method is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first parameter, giving it access to class-level data. This allows it to modify class variables and is often used for factory methods or configuration changes that should apply to all instances. On the other hand, a static method, defined with the @staticmethod decorator, takes no special first parameter (neither self nor cls) and behaves like a regular function but is logically grouped within the class’s namespace. Static methods don’t access or modify the state of the class or any instance—they’re typically used as utility functions that are related to the class's purpose.\n"

        "    1. Modularity:\n",
        "OOP breaks down a program into smaller, self-contained objects (classes), making it modular. Each class encapsulates data and behavior, which makes the code easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain.\n",

A @staticmethod is a method that does not take self or cls as the first parameter and behaves like a plain function that just happens to live inside a class. It cannot access or modify class or instance data and is typically used for utility functions. On the other hand, a @classmethod takes cls as the first argument, referring to the class itself (not an instance), and can access or modify class state shared among all instances. This makes @classmethod useful for creating alternative constructors or for methods that need to operate on the class as a whole rather than individual objects.\n",

When combined with inheritance, polymorphism lets a base class define a method, and then lets derived classes override that method with their own version. At runtime, Python will automatically choose the correct method based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type.

This is made possible by designing each method to return self (the current instance of the object). It leads to more concise and readable code, especially when performing a sequence of operations on an object. Method chaining is commonly seen in libraries like Pandas and Django ORM, and it can also be implemented in custom classes to improve usability and flow."

        "   - The call method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a regular function. By defining call in a class, you enable objects of that class to behave like callable functions, providing a flexible and powerful way to encapsulate behavior. This is especially useful in contexts like function objects, decorators, and customizable callable behaviors. When an object is followed by parentheses—obj()—Python looks for a call method and executes it if found. It helps make your code cleaner and more intuitive by letting objects act like functions when needed."
